# Purpose
This project purpose is to compute Collatz conjecture flight time of numbers pass the 2³³-1 mark.
Then store the result in order to make a public library of the results

# Features
The ```"stdintlib.h"``` library is used to compute and store the numbers.
Then ```"stdsocket.h"``` is used to create the necessary socket to communicate from the C library to the interface written in Java
### Support
-Bit-wise left and right shift 

-Addition 

-Naive multiplication algorithm

-Print to base 2 and base 10
